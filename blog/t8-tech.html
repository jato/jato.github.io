  <h1>Regular Expressions</h1>
  <h2>Getting Fancy</h2>
  <h4>August 10, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
       For this blog, I will attempt to learn about and explain regular expressions. I have not yet had the opportunity to implement any into code, so this should be fun (mild sarcasm). 

 

    </p>
    <p>
      A regular expression (also known as regex or regexp) is a specific text string used for describing a search pattern. It’s similar to the “wildcard” notation that we’ve seen often such as:
       <code>*.mp3</code>
      This would call a search in your directory with the ‘splat’ operator (or asterisk) for all files that contain the ‘.mp3’ extension.  The splat works like a wildcard. Now a regex expression would look like this:
      <code>.*\.mp3$</code>
      It can do much more than a simple splat can. For example this:
      <code>\b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b</code>
      can run a universal search for an email address, despite the numerous characters and numbers that typically comprise an email address.


    </p>
    <p>
      They can do much more than that, including pattern matching, and find and replace operations. They are implemented into pretty much every major language including Ruby and JavaScript.

   height: 0,
   weight: 0,
   passTest: <span style="font-weight: bold">true</span>
}
</pre></div>


 
    </p>


    <p>

    <p>
      But how exactly do they work?

  
      </p>
      <p>
      Have you ever opened an image in a web browser and just got a bunch gibberish with weird symbols and such? That’s sort of like the metadata, a series of characters and strings arranged in a particular order to initiate a literal meaning. A regex translates each character into a metacharacter, a character that has special meaning to a computer program. The metacharacter is an underlay of nearly every string, array, and character we type. So a regex can search within these metacharacters (called atoms) and look for a specific pattern, when it finds the pattern it returns the result. 
      </p>



    <p>
        Another example of a useful regex search would be for different dialect differences such as in the word “color” or “colour”. One could type colo[u]r and the regex would find both variants of the word used (also grey and gray). Search engines also have this type of function implemented natively.

    <!-- <p>
    <div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="font-weight: bold">function</span> dog (name, breed, age) {
  <span style="font-weight: bold">this</span>.name = name;
  <span style="font-weight: bold">this</span>.breed = breed;
  <span style="font-weight: bold">this</span>.age = age;
}
</pre></div>

 
</p> -->
<p>
They can range from an extremely simple and easy to remember syntax such as the example above, or extremely complex and long expressions that will take a few tries to get right. 
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this blog post serves primarily as an introduction, I won’t get into the nitty gritty exploration of the syntax, but it should be noted as an extremely useful tool for any programmer.
