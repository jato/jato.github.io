  <h1>Questions</h1>
  <h2>Asking the 'right' question</h2>
  <h4>September 3, 2015</h4>

   <p>
If I want an answer to my question, I try to keep this in the back of my mind. 




    </p>
    <p> 
Be short and concise. If people are reading your question, they have offered their time to help, but you must be respectful of their time as well. 


    </p>
    <p>
Be clear. If someone can figure our what you’re asking in 20 seconds or less, you lose their attention and possibly the answer to the question you sought. 


    </p>
    <p>
Do your research first. If your question can be answered via a cursory Google search, it looks like you put little effort into answering it yourself. People don’t want to do your work for you. 
 

    </p>
    <p>
Be polite. Ask for help politely, don’t demand it. Be thankful for responses even if they don’t quite answer your question or if you don’t find them to be helpful. They took an effort to help and be thankful for that. 
 

    <p>
If you don’t get a response. Your question either stumped your audience, or, it violates one of the above principles, give it some time and try again later.
