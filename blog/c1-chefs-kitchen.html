      Sometimes I worry that I’ve gotten way over my head. Then I check the calendar… “Oh god, it’s only week 1!” I take a step back and close my eyes, I take a few deep breaths, and ask myself why I’m doing this. The answer I give is always the same, I’m doing this for me. Nothing else really matters; success and failure are just the names of the streets you pass on your way home. Believe me, I’ve walked down those streets plenty of times, the scenery never changes.

        I’m here at DBC to learn. What I learn is entirely dependent upon myself. There is no intrinsic limitation to one’s ability to learn. That being said, everybody has a different way of learning. Some need more time, some need examples, and some need to work with others. I think I’d need to check all of the above boxes.

        DBC makes a point in telling us that there is more to being a programmer than being a good programmer. No, that’s not a typo, and yes, it makes perfect sense. There’s more to writing code, it’s about collaboration, mindfulness, and exploring one’s potential by pushing themselves to the absolute limit. We will need to know how to work with others, and be mindful and empathic towards their emotions. It’s the human element that makes for great programs. We push ourselves because we can. It’s how we grow, and discover new talent.

        Am I nervous? You bet I am. I’ve been wondering if I’ve slightly gone mad to be honest. To leave behind my friends and family, and challenge myself in a new city to participate in an “experiment”? Sounds crazy. But if I’m true to myself, and work to the best of my ability — what have I got to lose?
